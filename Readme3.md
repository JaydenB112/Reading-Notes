This is how you write a paragraph, that's light work. Line breaks are finished. Today we set up all our accounts for Github, Canvas, and Slack

Coding in markdown seems very forgiving, you don't have to worry about the strict rules of other formats.

You don't have to indent with paragraphs, luckily markdown does it for you

This is both, it could get REALLY confusing! Using different methods of each could be key if you arent't well versed! (WE AREN'T!)
