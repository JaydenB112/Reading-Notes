## Domain Modeling
1. Explain why we need domain modeling.

    Domain Modeling gives you an interactive view at the concept you are trying to create, it provides a way more dynamic experience than a regular wireframe, and helps you get your idea in perspective.

## HTML Table Basics
1. Why should tables not be used for page layouts?
   
    Tables reduce accessibility for visually impaired users, it can be a lot more difficult to code because it's overall a more complex system than traditional layout methods. Additionally tables aren't responsive by default, so that's even more code you have to complete.

2. List and describe 3 different semantic HTML elements used in an HTML table.

        The first element you need to use is the table element, this represents the data you put into it and shows you where your table starts and ends.
          
        The next element you need is the < tr > element, this creates the table rows which is how you information is grouped.

        The last element you need is the < td > element, these are the individual cells that each have separate data inside, usually the individual statistics being collected.

## Intro to Constructor Functions
1. What is a constructor and what are some advantages to using it?
       
        Constructors are functions and they can be used to streamline creating object literals, instead of making them individually you can make multiple in way less steps by making a constructor.

2. How does the term this differ when used in an object literal versus when used in a constructor?

        In an object this is just used to reference things inside the object, in constructors though, it creates variables or things that need to be accounted for inside the object.

## Object Prototypes Using Constructors
1. Explain prototypes and inheritance via an analogy from your previous work experience.

        A prototype is like your trainer at your job, you inherit a lot of the skills you are taught, and eventually move on, with those same skills and the capacity to learn new ones at your new job, you aren't your trainer because you learned some stuff from them, you are your own individual because you can still learn even more.
