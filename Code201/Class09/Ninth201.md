## HTML Forms
1. Why are forms so important in web development?

Forms allow users to input data directly into a websites local storage and can save anything to user preferences to usernames and passwords (hopefully with a secure server).

2. When designing a form, what are some key things to keep in mind when it comes to user experience?

Making sure all the fundamental needs of the form are met and that functionality is taken care of, clear wording for what you are asking of the user, and using fonts and font colors that complement each other and are easy to see.

3. List 5 form elements and explain their importance.

Input Element: Used to collect user input, without it there is no data from user to your website.

Select Element: The select element is used to create dropdowns to a list of options or features, helps keep forms compact while including all the necessary information they need.

textarea element: The textarea element sets a multi line text box that lets users input freeform text in a set size.

Checkboxes: The checkbox element is used when users need to select one or more options from a list of options. This element is useful when you want to give the user the freedom to select multiple options.

Submit Button: The submit button element is used to submit a form to a server for processing. This element is important because it allows users to take actions based on the information they have provided in the form.

## Javascript
1. How would you describe events to a non-technical friend? 

Events are just things that happen in a website, take a deep breath that was an event right there.

2. When using the addEventListener() method, what 2 arguments will you need to provide?

What cues the event like "click" or "hover" and then what exactly happens, probably a function you made to define just that.

3. Describe the event object. Why is the target within the event object useful?

Because you know exactly where the event is going to happen on your page and can better manipulate the event further from a specific place.
 
4. What is the difference between event bubbling and event capturing?

Event capturing is just capturing the event at the outermost event and works it's way all the way to the target event.

Event bubbling is the direct opposite it starts at the target and works it's way up.
