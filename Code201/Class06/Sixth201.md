# Javascript Objects
1. How would you describe an object to a non-technical friend you grew up with?
    
    An object is like a clear moving container, we use it because you can put a lot of different things in there that can be easily accessed.

2. What are some advantages to creating object literals?
   
    It's a lot more efficient and helps you call on structured data more quickly.

3. How do objects differ from arrays?
   
    Objects can contain arrays, while they are both used to store data, objects can contain a wider scope of information in it.

4. Give an example for when you would need to use bracket notation to access an objectâ€™s property instead of dot notation.
    When you are updating the value of something in your object, adding a property to a value.

5. Evaluate the code below. What does the term this refer to and what is the advantage to using this?
   
    This refers to a variable you set in the object, it's benefit is quickly being able to refer and call on variables within the object without having to use the objects name.

    ## The DOM
    1. What is the DOM?
       
        Document Object Model or "DOM" is how the data is a representation of how the webpage looks, it allows for the 
        webpage to be manipulated in a more direct way.
   
   
   2.  Briefly describe the relationship between the DOM and JavaScript.
        
        They work hand in hand, the DOM is not a programming language, but Javascript needs it to understand the model of a webpage.
