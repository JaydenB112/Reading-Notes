## Troubleshooting

1. Name some key differences between a Syntax Error and a Logic Error.

Syntax errors are just spelling errors while logic errors are your code itself either working against itself or just faulty code in general.

2. List a few types of errors that you have encountered in past lab assignments and explain how you were able to correct them.

Mostly syntax errors, and it's just being more conscience of your code as you're typing it and proofreading.


3. How will this topic continue to influence your long term goals?

Troubleshooting is apart of coding so being more knowledgeable of what's going on will help in general.

## Javascript Debugging
1. How would you describe the JavaScript Debugger tool and how it works to someone just starting out in software development?

It helps you see clearly where you went wrong.

2. Define what a breakpoint is.

A point in your code where it stops executing


3. What is the call stack?

All the code you executed to get to the current line.
