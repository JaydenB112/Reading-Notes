    The ability to use video and audio on the web has evolved from requiring specific plugins or media players to becoming an integral part of the web platform itself, with native support for playback and real-time communication. This has allowed for more accessible, standardized, and sophisticated video and audio experiences on the web

2. Describe the use of the src and controls attributes in the <video> element.

        The src element is the path to the video you want to use. Controls manipulates video playback, an integral part of user accessibility.

3. Why is it important to have fallback content inside the <video> element?

    Because different browsers use different things, for accessibility of the user it's imperative to have multiple fallbacks

## Responsive Images
1. Besides making a site visually appealing across different screen sizes, why should developers make images responsive?

For efficiency reasons the way I see it is, if you can make something do two or three jobs instead of one why not jump at that opportunity.

2. Define the following <img> attributes srcset and sizes. Write an example of how they are used.

Srcset defines how many images the browser can use at a time and what size it is.

Sizes determines the set of media conditions and indicates what image size would be best to use.

Because it's more streamline and less red tape.
