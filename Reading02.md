## Text Editor Features and the Reason you want Them
The author describes four important features that go into a great text editor. I listed and defined them below
1. Code Completion- Basically autofill for code, giving you multiple suggestions to fill put your code, it reduces the risk of messing up and having to trace back your steps when you're coding a lot of lines.
2. Syntax Highlighting- essentially making your code bright colors to easily see it, it can make it easier because each command is defined by a color it's a good quality of life tool in my opinion and a good thing to look for in a text editor.
3. Themes- a lot of ways to change the appearence of your text editor to make it more appealing, in a world as individualized as coding it's important to have just as much freedom in the appearence your text editor.
4. Extensions- essentially the freedom to download any extra flavor you may want to your text editor, ranging from github to honeybrew, extensions make life a lot easier.

Pretty much every computer already has a text editor, but one of the main reason people look for a new one is because the already installed one may or may not have all of the features previously noted.

It's more than possible to make a website using a text editor without these options, but it would make a lot more difficult and less enjoyable with an already tedious task at hand.
## Text Editors and IDEs

An IDE is a little bit different from a text editor, unlike text editors IDEs have all types of different software centralized in one place.
The problem with IDE's is that they can have a lot of stuff that you may not ever use, but at least you have it.

## Linux Command Lines
Command Lines are a common way on how we get things done on computers

Line one of a command line usually starts with a prompt, you input a command after, we get an argument (I think this is the command and terminal communicating but I'm not sure?)

Line 2-5 are the output from the command, sometimes it may take a while for it to show up, it just means it's still running

After the command is done running, you will be shown a prompt just like line 1

## Opening A Terminal/ The Shell and Bash
If you want to remotely log onto a terminal you will need a 3rd party application called a SSH client the article suggests one called Putty that's free.

Inside a terminal you have a shell, this defines how the terminal behaves and how it looks when the terminal executes commands.

Bash is a common shell that people uses and it uses a command called 'echo'

Echo displays a system variable stating the current shell, it's used to siaplay message.

(Shortcuts shorten the time it takes to code, take note of them and take advantage!)

## Navigating Linux

In this section it just talks about getting around Linux easier, which can save a **LOT** of time in the long run.

The first command featured is pwd which is **Print Working Directory** this command allows you to see your current directory

The command **ls** basically shows us what's at our current location we got too by usind **pwd** 

## Paths 
A Files or Directory in a command line is considered a path, (A path is getting to a specific file)

### Absolute and Relative Paths
Absolute and Relative paths are used whenever we are getting a specific file or directory.

Linux file systems are like a pyramid in design, at the top of it lies the **root** directory it's usually indicated by one slash, and it has subdirectories, and those subdirectories have subdirectories and it trickles down.

Absolute paths show a location file in relation to the root directory it will usually have a forward slash.

Relative Paths specify a location file in relation to where we are in the system. They won't have a slash.

cd stands for **change directory**

## Quick Tip
Instead of risking a typo, you can use tab to autocomplete your code, just press tab when coding and it will show you what you can type, is there is multiple possibilities you can press tab again to show you all of them.
