## Text Editor Features and the Reason you want Them
The author describes four important features that go into a great text editor. I listed and defined them below
1. Code Completion- Basically autofill for code, giving you multiple suggestions to fill put your code, it reduces the risk of messing up and having to trace back your steps when you're coding a lot of lines.
2. Syntax Highlighting- essentially making your code bright colors to easily see it, it can make it easier because each command is defined by a color it's a good quality of life tool in my opinion and a good thing to look for in a text editor.
3. Themes- a lot of ways to change the appearence of your text editor to make it more appealing, in a world as individualized as coding it's important to have just as much freedom in the appearence your text editor.
4. Extensions- essentially the freedom to download any extra flavor you may want to your text editor, ranging from github to honeybrew, extensions make life a lot easier.

Pretty much every computer already has a text editor, but one of the main reason people look for a new one is because the already installed one may or may not have all of the features previously noted.

It's more than possible to make a website using a text editor without these options, but it would make a lot more difficult and less enjoyable with an already tedious task at hand.
## Text Editors and IDEs

An IDE is a little bit different from a text editor, unlike text editors IDEs have all types of different software centralized in one place.
The problem with IDE's is that they can have a lot of stuff that you may not ever use, but at least you have it.
