## Learning about headings from [Markdown Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/)

This is how you write a paragraph, that's light work.
Line breaks are finished.
Today we set up all our accounts for Github, Canvas, and Slack

Coding in markdown seems very forgiving, you don't have to worry about the strict rules of other formats.

You don't have to indent with paragraphs, luckily markdown does it for you

Remember to use spaces after hashtags for  headings

There are multiple ways to do things in markdown, there's like four ways to make text **bold!**

*Italicized* text and **bold text** are really close format wise, I'd suggest adopting a different way to do both since there are multiple.

***This is both, it could get REALLY confusing! Using different methods of each could be key if you arent't well versed! (WE AREN'T!)***

## Things I want to Know more About
- If anything the history behind the format itself, why was it created?
- If markdown is as simple as this to learn, why isn't it more popular in developer communities? Is it restrictive?
- It it is then how so?
- If you just knew markdown, like that was the only language you knew, how much is that skill alone worth on the market? I know it's not a lot but still.
