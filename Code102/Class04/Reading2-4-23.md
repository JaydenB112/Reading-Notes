## What is Wireframing?
Wireframing is the skeleton of a website, app, or modification. Basically the designer or client emphasizing how information is perceived.

Wireframing lets you plan the outline of a website without all the color and font options of another method. 

Wireframing can be done by hand, or on your machine with different software.
On paper, wireframing can be edited very easily, and at every stage can be reviewed by outside perspective.After, you can transfer to a software to make more detailed changes.

Wireframing can be structured in many different ways, it's best to find the structure that works best for you.

Remember, to keep it simplistic, you don't have to draw a detailed picture to wireframe, you just need to get the basic idea and theme of how you want your website to look. you can add the details later when it's time to test it.

There are courses available to teach you how to wireframe, some of them are free and you can become a UX designer, in a 5-10 month program.
