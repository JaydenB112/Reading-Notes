Wireframing can be structured in many different ways, it's best to find the structure that works best for you.

Remember, to keep it simplistic, you don't have to draw a detailed picture to wireframe, you just need to get the basic idea and theme of how you want your website to look. you can add the details later when it's time to test it.

There are courses available to teach you how to wireframe, some of them are free and you can become a UX designer, in a 5-10 month program.
