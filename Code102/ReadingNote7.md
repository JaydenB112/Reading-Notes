## Control Flow
The control flow is the order in which the computer takes care of the script you give it.

Code works by running from the first line to the last line, unless there is a structure like a loop or a conditional.

These are natural parts of a script and can be set for when **events** occur.

Understanding Control Flow is not just about understanding the start and finish but also the program structure for any possible breaks in it's natural path.

## Expressions and Operators
This chapter describes JavaScript's expressions and operators, including assignment, comparison, arithmetic, bitwise, logical, string, ternary and more.

At a high level, an expression is a valid unit of code that resolves to a value. There are two types of expressions: those that have side effects (such as assigning values) and those that purely evaluate.

The expression x = 7 is an example of the first type. This expression uses the = operator to assign the value seven to the variable x. The expression itself evaluates to 7.

The expression 3 + 4 is an example of the second type. This expression uses the + operator to add 3 and 4 together and produces a value, 7. However, if it's not eventually part of a bigger construct (for example, a variable declaration like const z = 3 + 4), its result will be immediately discarded â€” this is usually a programmer mistake because the evaluation doesn't produce any effects.
